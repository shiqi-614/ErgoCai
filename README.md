# ErgoDoxTW
Change was made based on [ErgoDone v1.5](https://github.com/ktec-hq/ErgoDone/commit/091d1d12327a9dc95b3b4be09c8e6d85ce0d4d30)  

## PCB Preview in KiCad
![pcb preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keyman-Taiwan/ErgoDoxTW/master/preview/full_preview_small.png)
You can find a larger image in the preview folder.

`IMPORTANT`: v1.4 has been validated.

## Difference/Improvement with ErgoDone
1. Rollback to use Teensy 2.0 for main controller (same as ErgoDox)
2. Rollback to use MCP23018 for IO expander (same as ErgoDox)
3. USB Type-C connector (only support USB 2.0 due to Teensy 2.0)
4. Support to use Kailh / Gateron hot plug socket
5. Support to use SMD 1206 component for Resistor and Capacitor
6. Change TRRS socket to PJ-320A and PJ-320E, which is more easy to find and cheapper. (please check folder ref_data/3.5mm
)
7. **`ONLY`** support 76 keys due to component change and pcb layout change.
